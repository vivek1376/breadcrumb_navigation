    This web page demonstrates "breadcrumb" navigation feature,
    and was designed using HTML, CSS & jQuery. Click on a Red item, to open
        sub-items, notice the top bar shows the path you took from the
        root item. Click on any link in the path, in order to jump directly to
        its sub-item list.

        Breadcrumb navigation feature in a useful technique in improving
        usability in navigating web-pages. If there are a bunch of
        webpages arranged in a hierarchical manner;
        starting from the root node(web page), you can go down the
        child nodes (web pages), and the path traced will be saved in
        the form of a "breadcrumb" trail and will be displayed on the
        top as a navigation bar. Moving deeper into the hierarchy will
        keep updating the breadcrumb trail. Also, you can directly jump
        on any intermediate node item in the trail by clicking it on the
        nav-bar.
